    Dog Years Calculator: American Veternarianlsdkfjds
    To estimate a dog's age in human years, a general guideline is to consider the first year of a dog's life as equivalent to 15 human years. The second year is roughly 9 human years, and subsequent years can be estimated as 4-5 human years each.

    Enter Dog's Age:
    Large/small
    
    5 year old large dog: 15 + 9 + (5-2) * 5  = 39 years
    7 year old small dog: 15 + 9 + (7-2) * 4 = 44 years
